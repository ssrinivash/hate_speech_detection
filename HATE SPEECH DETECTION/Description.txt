Import Libraries
Importing the necessary libraries, including pandas for manipulating the data, the natural language processing library nltk, re (regular expression) for text cleaning, and the set of tools from scikit-learn for building a classification model like DecisionTreeClassifier.

Data Input:
The data is loaded from a CSV file, twitter.csv, with the associated class of each tweet; they would be either Hate Speech class 0, Offensive Language class 1, or No Hate and Offensive class 2.
This class column is aliased to labels:
0 → Hate Speech
1 → Crass language
2 → No Hate and Offensive

Data scrubbing:
A function clean() is defined to preprocess and clean the tweet text.
Write all the text in lowercase.
Remove special characters such as URLs, punctuation, and numbers.
Elimination of stop words. Stop words are those words that have no much meaning to the text, such as "the," "is," etc.
Apply stemming using nltk.SnowballStemmer, which reduces words to their root form "running" reduces to "run".
This cleaned data is then fed back into the tweet column of the dataset.

Feature Extraction:
The CountVectorizer is used for transforming the clean tweets into numerical vectors that represent word frequencies as input features for the machine learning model.

Splitting the Data:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split(). Here, 33 percent of the data is kept as test data, and the rest will be used for training:.

Training the Model: 
A Decision Tree Classifier is initialized and fit on the transformed tweet data (X_train) along with their corresponding labels (y_train).
The Decision Tree Classifier is a supervised learning algorithm, trying to split the data on feature values in order to classify a tweet in any of the three categories.

Model Testing and Precision: 
Upon training the model, it is tested using the test set X_test. Here, the predicted labels are compared with the actual ones, given as y_test. The model prints out the accuracy score, which gives the percentage of how well the model performs in classifying the tweets. 

Sample Forecast: The model is used to predict whether a sample tweet ("good kill") indicates hate speech, offense, or neither by first passing the text through the CountVectorizer and then applying it to the model.
